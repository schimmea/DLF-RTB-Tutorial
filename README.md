# Deep Landscape Forecasting for Real-time Bidding Advertising (Winter 2020/21)
In their Paper, Ren et al. (2018) address the problem of bid landscape forecasting in real-time online advertisement auctions. They employ and compare different survival analysis methods and propose a novel way of predicting the price distributions, improving on past research in multiple ways.

In the provided notebook, we give a brief introduction into how real-time bidding works, what survival analysis is, and how the two can be brought together in an insightful way. Afterwards, we discuss the key points of the proposed new method and how it improves upon previous work.
